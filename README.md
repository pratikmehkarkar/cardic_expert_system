# Expert System for Cardiovascular Diseases - Artificial Intelligence 

Nowadays Cardiovascular diseases are the most common among people and those are very life-threatening in some cases. For the same, I have developed an rule based expert system that will predict the possibility or chance of a person getting cardiovascular diseases based on certain factors or symptoms. Once the disease prediction will get done, the system will provide a further flow of treatment for the patient. The flow of treatment includes several diagnostic tests which belong to radiology or catheterization laboratory. This rule based expert system for cardiovascular disease performs a goal driven state space search, which is based on a forward chaining mechanism through which rules are selected to be fired. To discover the illness or to find the answers, I've used the responses being provided by the user to the question and different rules within the working memory till we tend to get the matching condition.

Features:
1) Prediction of some common types of cardiovascular diseases
2) Showing the required flow of treatment for the patient
3) System can also able to determine the certainty factor of the disease predictions

Note: All the medical terms & diagnostics tests suggested by our system are suggested by a consultant cardiologist.
